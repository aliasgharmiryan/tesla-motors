            <h1 class="kale">Tesla model S</h1>
            <p>
                The Model S is a five-door liftback sedan. Deliveries began on June 22, 2012. The car became the first electric vehicle to top the monthly sales ranking in any country, when it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013. The Model S won the 2013 Motor Trend Car of the Year, the 2013 "World Green Car", Automobile magazine's 2013 "Car of the Year", Time magazine's Best 25 Inventions of the Year 2012 award, as well as the 2019 Motor Trend "Ultimate Car of the Year".

                The Model S was the best-selling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016, selling an estimated 50,931 units in 2016. By the end of 2017, it listed as the world's second best selling plug-in electric car in history after the Nissan Leaf, with global sales of 200,000 units. In June 2020, Tesla announced that the Model S Long Range Plus had an EPA range of 402 miles (647 km), the highest of any battery electric car at the time.

                <h1 class="mod3">Tesla model 3</h1>
                <p>The Model 3 is an electric fastback mid-size four-door sedan developed by Tesla. The Model 3 Standard Range Plus version delivers an EPA-rated all-electric range of 263 miles (423 km) and the Long Range versions deliver 353 miles (568 km). According to Tesla, the Model 3 carries full self-driving hardware, with periodic software updates adding functionality.

                    Limited production of the Model 3 began in mid-2017, with the first production vehicle rolling off the assembly line on July 7, 2017.[12][13][14] The official launch and delivery of the first 30 cars took place on July 28.
                    
                    The Model 3 was marketed as being more affordable to more people than some other models by Tesla. Since early 2020, the Model 3 is the world's best-selling electric car in history,[16] with more than 800,000 units delivered through December 2020. The Model 3 has been the world's top selling plug-in electric car (PEV) for three years running, from 2018 to 2020. It has also been the best-selling PEV in the United States for three consecutive years, 2018 to 2020, the top selling PEV in Europe in 2019, and the best-selling PEV in China in 2020. In 2020, Tesla produced over 450,000 of the Model 3/Y chassis automobiles.</p>
